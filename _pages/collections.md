<b>[Tracking-Control](https://github.com/Zheng-Meng/Tracking-Control)</b>
<img alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zheng-meng/tracking-control?style=social"><br>
A model-free, machine-learning framework to control a robotic manipulator using only partially observed states, where the controller is realized by reservoir computing. The effectiveness is demonstrated using a variety of periodic and chaotic signals. <br>

<b>[Reservoir-Computing-and-Hyperparameter-Optimization](https://github.com/Zheng-Meng/Reservoir-Computing-and-Hyperparameter-Optimization)</b>
<img alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zheng-meng/reservoir-computing-and-hyperparameter-optimization?style=social"><br>
Reservoir computing (echo state network) for short- and long-term prediction of chaotic systems, with tasks Lorenz and Mackey-Glass systems as examples. Bayesian optimization (hyperparameter optimization algorithm) is used to tune the hyperparameters and improve the performance.<br>

<b>[Parameter-Tracking-with-Machine-Learning](https://github.com/Zheng-Meng/Parameter-Tracking-with-Machine-Learning)</b>
<img alt="GitHub Repo stars" src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/zheng-meng/Parameter-Tracking-with-Machine-Learning?style=social"><br>
Tracking parameters within the system from which only partial state observation is available. Main features: (1) Only the measurements from a partial set of the dynamical variables are needed, (2) it only requires several constant parameter values in the training phase, (3) the historical parameter values are not required in real-time parameter tracking. <br>

Zheng-Meng Zhai (翟正蒙) is a Ph.D. student in Prof. [Ying-Cheng Lai](http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~ylai1/)'s chaos research group at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). His background is in physics and electrical engineering, with a strong interest in nonlinear dynamics and chaos, machine learning and neural networks, as well as time series analysis.

His research primarily focuses on solving problems in nonlinear dynamics using machine learning. His current research interests include:

* Inverse modeling with machine learning, such as parameters extraction/tracking
* Nonlinear trajectory tracking control using machine learning
* Machine learning applications in magnetic navigation
* Reservoir computing mechanisms and properties, and their relationship to the brain
* Chaotic systems short- and long-term prediction by machine learning

Hi! I am Zheng-Meng Zhai (翟正蒙), a fifth-year Ph.D. student in Prof. [Ying-Cheng Lai](http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~ylai1/)'s chaos group at Arizona State University. 

I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from Southwest Jiaotong University, and my Master's degree in Theoretical Physics from East China Normal University, where I was advised by Prof. [Ming Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z7ygE20AAAAJ&hl=en). My background is in physics and electrical engineering, with research focus on combining **machine learning** with **nonlinear dynamics**. My current research projects include:

* System dynamics recovery using hybrid transformer and reservoir computing methods
* Model-free nonlinear control 
* Machine learning mechanisms and physics-inspired machine learning
* Chaotic systems forecasting with machine learning

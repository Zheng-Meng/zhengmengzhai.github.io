Hi! I am Zheng-Meng Zhai (翟正蒙), a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Prof. [Ying-Cheng Lai](http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~ylai1/)'s chaos research group at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Electronic Information Science and Technology from [Southwest Jiaotong University](https://en.swjtu.edu.cn/), and my Master's degree in Theoretical Physics from [East China Normal University](https://english.ecnu.edu.cn/), where I was advised by Prof. [Ming Tang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z7ygE20AAAAJ&hl=en). My background is in physics and electrical engineering, with research focus on combining **machine learning and neural networks** with **nonlinear dynamics and chaos**. Specifically, my current research projects include:

* System dynamics recovery using hybrid transformer and reservoir computing methods
* Inverse modeling by machine learning
* Model-free nonlinear tracking control 
* Machine learning mechanisms and physics-inspired machine learning
* Chaotic systems forecasting with machine learning

I will be graduating in the end of 2025 and am actively seeking a **postdoctoral** position. I would greatly appreciate any advice, opportunities, or connections!

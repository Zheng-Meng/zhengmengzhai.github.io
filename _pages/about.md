Zheng-Meng Zhai (翟正蒙) is a Ph.D. student in Prof. [Ying-Cheng Lai](http://chaos1.la.asu.edu/~ylai1/)'s chaos group at [Arizona State University](https://www.asu.edu/). His background is in physics and he is interested in nonlinear dynamics and chaos, machine learning and neural networks, and time series analysis. 

He currently focuses on integrating inverse modeling with machine learning to analyze nonlinear dynamical systems. Projects include parameter tracking, uneven sampling time series sampling, and more.

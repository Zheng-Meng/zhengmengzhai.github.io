### $\color{NavyBlue}{\textsf{Reservoir computing}}$
Reservoir computing (RC) is a type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It only train the readout weights using a linear regression, while the input weights and recurrent connection weights are left untrained. RC has a significant advantage over other RNNs due to its fast learning capability.

We use reservoir computing to address different issues in nonlinear systems, including complex dynamical trajectories tracking control, magnetic navigation, parameters tracking with partial state observation, and so on.

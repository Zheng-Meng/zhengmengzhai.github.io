### $\color{NavyBlue}{\textsf{Reservoir computing}}$

Reservoir computing (RC) is a type of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). It trains only the readout weights using linear regression, leaving the input weights and recurrent connection weights untrained. This approach gives RC a notable advantage over other RNNs, particularly in terms of rapid learning.

We have applied reservoir computing to tackle a range of challenges in nonlinear systems, including tracking control of complex dynamical trajectories, magnetic navigation, and parameter tracking under conditions of partial state observation, among other applications.
